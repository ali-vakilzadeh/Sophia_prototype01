Build a comprehensive cloud-based CRM system to help small-to-medium businesses manage customer relationships, sales pipelines, and marketing campaigns in one unified platform.

Background:
Our company has identified a gap in the market for an affordable, user-friendly CRM that doesn't require extensive training. Current solutions are either too expensive (Salesforce) or too limited in features (basic spreadsheet tracking). We aim to create a middle-ground solution that balances power with simplicity.
